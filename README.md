# Melee-CSS-Color-Changer

This program is used to change various colors on the character select screen of Super Smash Bros. Melee. The user just provides the appropriate MnSlChr.usd and adjusts the colors for background, top frame, bottom frame, rules, the many "selects" in the background, and more. 

The program does not currently suppport reading the color of background "selects." When updating the other colors and you don't want to overwrite your background "selects" color(s) then set the option to "None" for the "Background Selects:" combo box.
